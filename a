Dear Kirsta,

My name is Oviya Subasanthirabose and I am attaching my resume for the Digital Scholarship Unit Project Contributor position at the UTSC Library. I have a very strong knowledge in Tamil, having completed a Tamil Teaching Diploma course with the Canadian Tamil Academy. I learned many skills during this time, including how to accurately translating, transilerating and typing Tamil texts. I also have a great passion for the Tamil culture, language and history, participating and being a part of many Tamil organizations and events ever since I was a child. Not only have I explored and expanded my passion for Tamil, I have also become very comfortable creating and maintaining spreadsheets to keep track of event participants and other important data.  I am also very eager to learn and enjoy a good challenge, which would make me a good fit as a candidate. I would appreciate the opportunity to speak with you further in person regarding my experience, skills, accomplishments and the specific value I can add to your team. Please call me at 647-865-3838 or reply back to this email at oviya.subasanthirabose@mail.utoronto.ca to schedule a personal interview at your convenience.
